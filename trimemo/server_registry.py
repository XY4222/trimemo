"""Per-palace discovery registry for the TriMemo HTTP MCP hub.

``trimemo serve`` (and ``trimemo-mcp --transport http``) is meant to be
the single long-lived writer for a shared palace: once it performs its first
mutating tool call it holds the per-palace MCP writer lease (#1818) for its
whole lifetime, and every other process is refused palace writes. That is
correct for agents — they talk to the hub — but the background save hooks
and the plain CLI still spawn short-lived ``trimemo mine`` processes,
which would be refused while a hub is up and silently stop transcript
capture on the hub machine.

This module gives those local processes a way to find the hub instead of
fighting it: the HTTP transport records ``{pid, host, port, scheme,
read_only, capabilities, search_config_fingerprint}`` next to the per-palace
bearer token (``~/.mempalace/server/<key>/``), and callers use
:func:`read_live_serverinfo` to decide "forward this write over HTTP" vs
"no hub — do the write directly".

The registry is local-machine only by design: it lives under the user's
home, is keyed by the canonical palace path, and a record is trusted only
while the recorded pid is still alive *and still the same process* — a
crashed hub leaves a stale file that every reader ignores and the next hub
overwrites, and a pid the OS has since recycled cannot resurrect it (see
:func:`trimemo.procident.started_after`).
